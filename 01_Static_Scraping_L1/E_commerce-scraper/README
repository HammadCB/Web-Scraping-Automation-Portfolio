### 🌟 Key Features & Technical Proof

| Feature | Value to Client / Technical Proof | File Location |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Complete Inventory Collection** | Automatically iterates through a defined page range (`START_PAGE` to `END_PAGE`), ensuring the *entire* available inventory is scraped, not just the initial page. | `run_multi_page_scraper` function |
| **Professional Proxy Readiness** | Architecturally prepared for secure, high-volume scraping by including a dedicated configuration for paid client proxy services (`PROXY_ENABLED` / `MOCK_PROXY`). | `CONFIGURATION` section |
| **Data Cleansing & Formatting** | Cleans numerical data (e.g., removes currency symbols like `'€'` and trims whitespace) using `.replace()` and `.strip()`, ensuring the output CSV is suitable for immediate database import or analysis (Excel/Power BI). | `extract_product_data` function |
| **Efficient Session Management** | Utilizes `requests.Session()` to reuse TCP connections and maintain consistent headers across multiple page requests, significantly improving scraping speed and resource efficiency. | `run_multi_page_scraper` function |
| **Robust Error Handling** | Implements `response.raise_for_status()` and `try...except` blocks to gracefully handle and log HTTP errors (e.g., 404/500), preventing the script from crashing during execution. | `run_multi_page_scraper` function |
